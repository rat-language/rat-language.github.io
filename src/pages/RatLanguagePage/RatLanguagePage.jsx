        RAT: A Language That's More Than Just Cheese

          Introduction: Escaping the Snake Pit
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          In the beginning, there was Python, and it was goodâ€”except when it wasn't fast enough. Enter RAT, born from a desire to combine Python's readability with the speed of a caffeinated cheetah on a skateboard. Unlike in the natural world, in the jungle of programming, this RAT is no prey; it's a predator on a pixelated prowl.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          RAT excels in domains where performance is critical, such as high-frequency trading, gaming engines, and complex simulations. By leveraging a static type system and a compiled implementation, RAT scurries circles around Python in terms of raw speed.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          But RAT isn't just about speed. It's also about making coding fun again. With sleek syntax, cheeky keywords, and features that make you feel like you're coding in the future, RAT is the go-to language for developers who enjoy their code with a side of whimsy.

                    RAT supports all the basic types you'd expect, like <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>str</code>, and <code>bool</code>. But why stop there? RAT also offers <code>char</code>, <code>byte</code>, and <code>long</code> for those times when you need to get low-level.
                  </Typography>
                  <Typography paragraph>
                    But the real magic happens with RAT's collection types. Arrays and dictionaries can hold any type, including other collections. Imagine a world where you can have an array of dictionaries, each containing arrays of custom types. In RAT, that world is a reality.

                  <Typography paragraph>
                    Variables are block-scoped and can be declared as <code>const</code> or <code>var</code>. Functions can take zero or more parameters, and even support default values and variadic arguments.
